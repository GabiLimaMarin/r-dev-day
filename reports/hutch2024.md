R Dev Day @ Hutch, August 15th, 2024
================

## Participants

Due to limited space, this event was invite only. 
Participants were mainly selected based on previous engagement with outreach activities of the R Contribution Working Group (Bug BBQ, R Project Sprint, R Contributor Office Hours, C Study Group). 
Additional spaces were offered to participants at posit::conf(2024) with a background in R package development and community contribution. 

Due to the small numbers, EDIA summaries are not reported for this individual event (they will be summarised over multiple R Dev Days). Efforts were made to balance invitations over age and gender.
