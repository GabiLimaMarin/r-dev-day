# R Development Hackathon, 5 September, RSECon24

The R Development Hackathon at RSECon24 will take place across two sessions on Thursday 5 September:

11:00 - 12:30 Session 1  
14:00 - 15:15 Session 2

Participants are encourage to attend both sessions, so there is time to make progress on tasks.

Anyone with an interest in contributing to R, or in open source contribution more generally, is welcome to attend. We will be preparing tasks requiring a range of expertise, e.g. translating message strings to non-English languages, reviewing the design of a dashboard, improving R help files, testing patches in R/C code, debugging GUI behaviour, etc.

We also have a dedicated RSE slack channel for this dev day, "hackathon R development" ,which you can join here: https://rsecon24.slack.com/archives/C07J7H4HB8R

## Tasks for the hackathon

Tasks for the hackathon have been prepared as [issues on this repository with label `RSECon24`](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ARSECon24). You are also welcome to add issues or discuss ideas for issues as described in the repo [README](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/blob/main/README.md).

Issues are also arranged in the google sheet ["RSECon24 R Hackathon Working Group Allocations"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LQP-FkzYunmWj5HX6hLu8E2CO9vACYe4fWmz5cE3l38/edit?usp=sharing), which is where people can sign up for these issues.

Please keep an eye on the issues in the run up to the hackathon. You may need additional preparation to work on certain issues, e.g. learning to build R on macOS or reading background material. You can express an interest in a task by adding a comment or assigning yourself to the issue. You can assign yourself to multiple issues as it is not a final commitment, but you will probably only be able to work on one issue at the hackathon.

## Equipment

Participants are expected to bring their own laptop. Most people will be able to work through the browser only (using Weblate, GitHub browser interface or GitHub Codespaces). Work on OS-specific bugs may require using or building R on your own laptop.

If you cannot travel with your laptop, you are still welcome to join, as we will be working collaboratively in small groups and you can pair with someone that has a laptop.

## Preparation

Some things you can do to help prepare if you have time:

 - [Request an account on R's Bugzilla](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/IssueTrack.html#bugzilla-account) if you would like to work on bugs in the code/documentation and don't yet have an account. The process can take a few days, but is only a "nice to have".
 - [Set up an account on Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/) if you would like to work on translations. This can also be done during the hackathon.
 - If you would like to work on bugs in the R code (vs the documentation, the R Translations Dashboard, or the R Dev Guide) and you are not comfortable with building R from source, we recommend learning to use the R Dev Container as described in the [participant resources list](../../blob/main/participant_resource_list.md) (~1 hour). This will not be required for all tasks involving code, but will open more possibilities.

The [participant resources list](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/blob/main/participant_resource_list.md) contains further links for learning more about contribution. Working through these in advance is entirely optional - we will aim to match you to tasks given your current knowledge and experience - but they will help you to get stuck in at the hackathon.

If you have any queries, feel free to reach out to Heather Turner, Saranjeet Kaur or Nick Tierney on the RSECon24 Slack.

## Working with remote participants

To work with participants that are joining remotely:

* Each group will have a Zoom breakout session they can use to text/video chat with people in their group
* Bringing headphones/earbuds would help so you can talk with less disruption/noise to remote participants
* You may also use the R Dev Container with [Live Share](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-dev-env/container_setup/live_share/) so that you can collaborate on code and have a space to text chat on the same platform. This does not require you to learn how to build R, the release version of R is already available in the R Dev Container.
* You can also join the dedicated RSE slack channel for this dev day: https://rsecon24.slack.com/archives/C07J7H4HB8R
